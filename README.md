# NFT Analytics Dashboard

**_Abstract_— The NFT Analytics Dashboard is a web application that provides real-time insights into the performance of a fake NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on the Ethereum blockchain. The dashboard displays key metrics such as total sales and views, as well as charts and graphs that show the sales and views over time, sales by country, and top buyers. The dashboard is built using Flask and Chart.js, and retrieves data from a simulated API endpoint. It is designed to be easily customizable and extendable to work with any NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFT Analytics Dashboard can help NFT creators and sellers track the performance of their assets and make data-driven decisions to optimize their sales and marketing strategies.**

# I.Introduction

The NFT Analytics Dashboard is a tool designed to provide insights and data visualizations for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs are unique digital assets that are becoming increasingly popular in various industries, including art, gaming, and sports. This dashboard provides a way for NFT owners and creators to track the performance of their NFTs and gain insights into user engagement and sales data.

The dashboard features various charts and graphs that display important metrics such as total sales, total views, sales by day of the week, sales by country, and more. Users can also filter and sort the data by various parameters such as date range and NFT name.

The dashboard is built using Python and Flask for the backend, and Chart.js and jQuery for the frontend. It retrieves NFT data from an API and uses JavaScript to update the charts and graphs in real-time. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

# II.Background

_OpenSea_: OpenSea is a popular decentralized marketplace for buying and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and provides a user-friendly platform for creators and collectors to interact with each other. OpenSea allows users to buy, sell, and trade various types of NFTs including artwork, collectibles, gaming items, and more.

_OpenSea API_: OpenSea provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to build applications that interact with the OpenSea marketplace. The API provides endpoints for retrieving NFT data such as assets, collections, and orders. It also supports functions for creating and updating NFT listings and orders. With the OpenSea API, developers can build a wide range of applications such as NFT marketplaces, analytics dashboards, and portfolio trackers. The API supports both REST and WebSocket protocols, making it flexible and easy to integrate with existing systems. Additionally, OpenSea provides a robust developer documentation and a community forum to help developers get started with building on the platform.

_Flask_: Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. It is designed to be simple and flexible, providing developers with the tools they need to build web applications quickly and easily.

The background for the NFT Analytics Dashboard project is to create a tool for analyzing the sales and views data of a fake NFT. The dashboard will display various charts and graphs to visualize the data, including a line chart for sales, a bar chart for views, and a pie chart for sales by country. The data will be retrieved from an API endpoint and updated in real-time using JavaScript and the Chart.js library. The dashboard will also display the total sales and views for the NFT. The goal of the project is to provide insights into the performance of the NFT and help users make informed decisions about their investments.

# III.Requirements

To build a NFT analysis webpage that can provide multiple analytical data about the token, the following background hardware and technical requirements are needed:

## A.Hardware Requirements:

### 1)A computer with a minimum of 8GB RAM and a multi-core processor.

### 2)Sufficient storage space to save the scraped data and downloaded posts.

### 3)Reliable internet connectivity to access Instagram and download posts.

## B.Technical Requirements:

### 1)API to fetch the data from the Blockchain network.

### 2)Programming language such as Python, and JavaScript to create the webpage

### 3)A web framework like Flask or Django to create the webpage to display the analytical data.

### 4)Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and create the webpage interface

### 5)A hosting platform to deploy the webpage and make it available online.

# IV.Conclusion and Future Work

Providing users with analytical data about their profiles and the ability to download all their posts is a great feature that can be useful to many people. In terms of future work, there are a few areas:

- Improve the user interface: Consider enhancing the user interface of your webpage to make it more visually appealing and intuitive. You can add more features such as a search bar to make it easier for users to find specific data.
- Expand the scope: Currently, your project focuses on providing analytical data and download options for individual profiles. However, you can consider expanding your scope to include the analysis of multiple profiles at once. This can be useful for businesses or social media agencies who manage multiple accounts.
- Enhance the analytics: You can consider adding more advanced analytics to your webpage. For instance, you can add sentiment analysis to gauge how people feel about a profile, or use machine learning algorithms to predict engagement rates.
- Ensure compliance with Instagram's Terms of Service: As you continue to work on your project, it's important to ensure that you are complying with Instagram's Terms of Service. Keep an eye on any updates or changes to their policies, and adjust your scraper accordingly.

Overall, there are many directions you can take your project in the future. Keep experimenting and learning, and you're sure to come up with new and exciting features for your users.
